# RoBERTa-Base for News Classification (FP16 Quantized)  
This is a RoBERTa-Base model fine-tuned on the **AG News dataset** for text classification. It categorizes news articles into one of four classes: **World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology**. The model has been further **quantized to FP16** for improved inference speed and reduced memory usage, making it efficient for deployment on resource-constrained environments.

## **Usage Instructions**  

### **Installation**  
```bash
pip install -U transformers torch
```

### **Loading the Model for Inference**  
```python
from transformers import RobertaForSequenceClassification, RobertaTokenizer
import torch

# Load the model and tokenizer
model_name = "AventIQ-AI/Roberta-Base-News-Classification"  # Update with your model ID
tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Move to GPU if available
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

# Function to predict category
def predict(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding="max_length", truncation=True, max_length=512).to(device)
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(**inputs)
    logits = outputs.logits
    predicted_class = torch.argmax(logits, dim=1).item()
    class_labels = {0: "World", 1: "Sports", 2: "Business", 3: "Science/Technology"}
    return class_labels[predicted_class]

# Example usage
custom_text = "Stock prices are rising due to global economic recovery."
predicted_label = predict(custom_text)
print(f"Predicted Category: {predicted_label}")
```

## **Quantization Details**  
- The model has been quantized to **FP16** to reduce its size and improve inference speed.
- FP16 quantization provides a **2x reduction in memory** while maintaining similar accuracy.

---

## **Limitations & Considerations**  
- The model is **trained on AG News** and may not generalize well to **other domains** such as medical, legal, or entertainment news.
- Due to **FP16 quantization**, there might be a minor loss in precision, but inference speed is significantly improved.
- The model is **not intended for real-time misinformation detection**â€”it only classifies text based on its most probable category.
